# IoT-Based Automatic Clothing Protection System

## Description
This project utilizes an IoT-based automatic clothing protection system that employs rain sensors to autonomously retrieve clothes during adverse weather conditions. The system is designed to protect clothes from getting wet and damaged by detecting rain and activating a servo motor to close the clothing line or cover.

## Key Features
- **Rain Detection**: Uses a rain sensor to monitor weather conditions.
- **Automatic Retrieval**: Activates a servo motor to retrieve clothes when rain is detected.
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Serial output for monitoring rain detection and system status.

## Components Used
- Rain Sensor
- Servo Motor
- Arduino Board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- Jumper Wires

## Setup Instructions
1. Connect the rain sensor to the designated pin on the Arduino.
2. Connect the servo motor to the Arduino.
3. Upload the provided Arduino code to the board.
4. Place the rain sensor in a location where it can accurately detect rain.

## Usage
- The system will continuously monitor for rain. When rain is detected, the servo motor will activate, and the system will retrieve clothes to protect them from the rain.
